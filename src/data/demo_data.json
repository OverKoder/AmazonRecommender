        "It's 75 degrees and sunny in St. Petersburg, FL but within the pleasant confines of producer Erik Rutan's increasingly popular Mana Studios come the sounds of the apocalypse; tones of the rhythmically sinister and fist-clenchingly metal variety. It is the audible battery of Goatwhore's Metal Blade debut A Haunting Curse. More molten than its gloomier predecessor, the disc stays true to the band's original irreverent Bathory-meets-Baal (the god of thunder) in a bullpen sensibility with punkish resolve and those inimitable Louisiana grooves for which the band has become known. Songs like ber oldschool \"Bloodletting Upon The Cloven Hoof,\" the opening \"Wear These Scars Of Testimony\" and \"Silence Marked By The Breaking Of Bone\" are fast, dark and antagonistic, Falgoust's commanding voice and challenging lyrics adding knee-buckling severity to their collective instrumental agility. Rhythms collide with stop-on-a-dime accuracy and Duet's vexing riffs give things a torrential horns-to-the-sky exigency. A Haunting Curse is here to devour. You have been warned."

        "After growing steadily behind two critically embraced and well-received albums, Engine Down present Demure, a full-length that will surprise their most ardent fans yet remain inviting and accessible to those unfamiliar with their efforts to date. Demure captures an intriguing level of introspection only subtly hinted at in previous work, and the underlying pattern throughout the album is efficiency. The group's approach towards their third full-length is that of repetitious, droning guitars complemented by simplistic syncopation. The soaring, reedy vocals of Keeley Davis stand monolithic and solitary, anchors for many songs on Demure. For Engine Down to wrench such complex passion out of a self-imposed limited sonic palette is truly an accomplishment. <P>However, to dismiss Demure as a somber, sullen, or understated work would be an injustice. The group's most recent metamorphosis removes the volatile flare of earlier incarnations, and the energy once used to produce the bright flash of earlier albums now is harnessed for an urgency underlying each part of the album. This makes Demure more than a mere collection of ten songs. Engine Down smartly dares the listener to find the complexities mired within the full-length by defacing many of the expected guides of dynamic contrast or bombastic yells typically used to convey earnestness or passion. <P>The beauty of this third full-length is its deceptive plainness, allowing for different interpretations upon the first or the tenth listen. Casual and knowledgeable listeners alike will find the steady rhythmic blink and contemplative drive alluring. Demure is a hypnotic, gorgeously crafted venture created by four individuals who realize that sometimes the best way to showcase talent is to subdue it.",
        "Engine Down formed in Harrisonburg, Virginia, in 1996, and have since relocated to Richmond, Virginia. This innovative quartet sprang out of such bands as Sleepytime Trio, The Weak Link Breaks, and Bughummer. <P>The foursome have truly come a long way, displaying that they are not afraid to take their sound to new limits with interesting instrumentation (e.g. piano, cello, vibraphone) while at the same time maintaining a dynamic and intense energy. The intrigue of this band lies in the fact that their successive works always incorporate fresh, novel sounds  it's quite easy to trace their ascent to maturity from early works to their latest full-length effort, Demure. <P>The band has no qualms about pushing against and recklessly crossing the parameters of a monotonous post-rock tradition; they execute a musical excellence that will doubtlessly capture a wide swath of listeners for a long time to come. This energy has captivated an enthusiastic audience: the band charted in CMJ's Top 20 for eight weeks. <P>Engine Down have toured and played with such diverse luminaries as Four Hundred Years, The Mercury Program, Milemarker, and the Locust and have no intention to stop. They completed a full European tour in fall 2001 and plan to tour Japan, the US, and Europe again in 2002. <P>Over time, Engine Down's sound has matured into a force not content with the now tired boundaries of hardcore or \"emo.\" Rather, Engine Down continue to hone their craft, surprising listeners with unexpected instruments and song structures."

Countless readers of <i>Five Acres and Independence</i> have come away with specific projects to begin and moved closer to the fulfillment of their dreams of independence on a small farm.<br />Whether you already own a suitable place or are still looking, <i>Five Acres and Independence</i> will help you learn to evaluate land for both its total economic and its specific agricultural possibilities. There are methods of calculating costs of permanent improvementsdraining the land, improving soil, planting wind breaks, putting in septic tanks, cellars, irrigation systems, greenhouses, etc.and methods of carrying out those improvements. There are suggestions for specific cropsstrawberries, grapes, vegetables, orchards, spring, summer, and fall crops, transplanting, timing, repairing what already existswith methods of deciding what is best for your land and purposes and techniques for making each of them pay. There are suggestions for animals for the small-scale farmergoats, chickens, beesand means of working them into your overall farm design. And there are suggestions for keeping your small farm in top production condition, methods of continually increasing the value of your farm, methods of marketing your produce and of accurately investing in improvementsvirtually everything a small-scale farmer needs to know to make his venture economically sound.<br />Some things, of course, have changed since 1940 when M. G. Kains revised <i>Five Acres and Independence.</i> But the basic down-to-earth advice of one of the most prominent men in American agriculture and the methods of farming the small-scale, pre-DDT farm are still essentially the same. Much of the information in this book was built on USDA and state farm bureau reports; almost all of it was personally tested by M. G. Kains, either on his own farms or on farms of the people who trusted him as an experienced consultant. His book went through more than 30 editions in the first 10 years after its original publication. It has helped countless small farmers attain their dreams, and it continues today as an exceptional resource for those who want to make their first farming attempt.<br />",

With undergraduate degrees from the University of Colorado in Physics and Astrophysics, he entered a career in aerospace systems, where he first encountered Six Sigma after Motorola won the inaugural Baldridge Award in 1988. Later, with graduate degrees in technical management and computer science from Johns Hopkins University and the University of Colorado, and as a member of the Hubble Telescope development team, he was intrigued by how breakdowns in the smallest components could lead to colossal system failures. He entered the Six Sigma industry in the mid-1990s, when he founded a software company to pursue product life-cycle traceability.<br /> Bruce has since been founder and CEO of two Six Sigma research and technology firms, and is now Chairman and CEO of Savvi International, a provider of solutions for business performance improvement using Six Sigma, lean, and business process management techniques.",

        "Our Original SCRUSHER boot and shoe brushes remove dirt, mud and slush from shoes and boots, making cleaning easier for you! This boot brush is safe for shoes and boots and is meant for year round outdoor use. Scrushers make a great gift! History of Scrusher: When Marcia Meshbesher told her husband to take his boots off before he came into the house, she planted the idea for what is now a Wisconsin-made product with worldwide distribution. In 1984, Meshbesher purchased a building in Chaseburg, Wisconsin without really knowing what they were going to do with it. That building became Chaseburg Manufacturing - Home of the SCRUSHER. In 1986, the company began producing the golf shoe SCRUSHER shoe brush after Meshbesher sold the idea to Standard Golf Equipment Company in Iowa. Now the SCRUSHER shoe and boot brush is on more than half of the golf courses in the U.S. and Europe. First came the golf shoe cleaner SCRUSHER, an industrial model and then a simple household shoe cleaner and boot cleaner version of Scrusher. In 1996 we built a new building in Coon Valley Wisconsin and expanded it again in 1998. Marcia passed away early in January of 2015 and we continue to build on her legacy of honesty, integrity and two SCRUSHERS for every household. One for the front door and one for the back door! Today the SCRUSHER shoe and boot cleaners come in many models, customized or personalized forms."
